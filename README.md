## Overview

### Project Specifications

- We have designed and developed a website that facilitates the booking of apartments and holiday homes, providing users with a range of features and functionality. The homepage of the website showcases all available apartments for rent, whether it be for a short-term stay or a longer holiday. Users can also access a map page that displays the location of each apartment.

- For each apartment, there is a dedicated page that provides detailed information about the property, including images, amenities, and pricing. From this page, users have the option to reserve the apartment by filling out a form that includes the desired dates of stay and the number of people.

- Once the user has completed the form, the website calculates the cost of the reservation, including any additional fees, and displays a booking confirmation page for the user to review before finalizing the payment. Overall, the website provides a seamless booking experience for users seeking temporary accommodation.
